Map with picker


Use Xamarin.Forms.Maps package - https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Forms.Maps
Use Pins to mark favorite areas on the map, you should have at least 5 pins. 
Utilize a Picker view element to allow users to choose viewing map in Hybrid, Satellite, or Street view mode. So when the user chooses a different map type it should dynamically change the map on the screen. The user should not be navigated to a new page.
Map should be created in XAML, you can add pins via code behind


What to turn in:

All xaml, xaml.cs, and any cs model files 
A pdf document with screenshots showing off above capabilities. As well as a sentence or two about what you found most difficult in the project.
